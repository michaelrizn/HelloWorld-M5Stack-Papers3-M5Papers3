## Introduction

This tutorial guides you through developing a simple application that displays "Hello, World!" on an E-paper display using the ESP32-S3 DevKitM-1 board. Leveraging the Arduino framework along with the [M5Unified](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Unified) and [epdiy](https://github.com/vroland/epdiy) libraries, you'll learn how to configure your environment, write the necessary code, and deploy it to your hardware. Prompt engineering techniques were utilized to enhance the development workflow.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

### Hardware

- **ESP32-S3 DevKitM-1** board
- **E-paper Display** compatible with the [epdiy](https://github.com/vroland/epdiy) library
- **USB Cable** to connect the ESP32-S3 DevKitM-1 to your computer
- **Connecting Wires** (if necessary) to interface the ESP32-S3 with the E-paper display

### Software

- **PlatformIO IDE**: A powerful, cross-platform IDE for embedded development.
- **Git**: Version control system for cloning repositories.
- **Arduino Framework**: Integrated with PlatformIO for development.

## Hardware Setup

1. **Connect the E-paper Display to ESP32-S3 DevKitM-1:**

   - Refer to the datasheets of both the ESP32-S3 DevKitM-1 and your specific E-paper display to ensure correct wiring.
   - Typically, you'll need to connect power (VCC and GND), SPI pins (MOSI, MISO, SCK), and any additional control pins required by the E-paper display.

2. **Verify Connections:**

   - Double-check all connections to prevent hardware damage.
   - Ensure the E-paper display is properly seated and connected.

## Software Setup

### 1. Install PlatformIO

PlatformIO can be installed as a plugin for popular editors like Visual Studio Code or as a standalone application.

- **Using Visual Studio Code:**
  - Open VS Code.
  - Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
  - Search for "PlatformIO IDE" and install it.

- **Standalone Installation:**
  - Visit the [PlatformIO Installation Page](https://platformio.org/install).
  - Follow the instructions for your operating system.

### 2. Install Git

If you don't have Git installed:

- **Windows:** Download and install from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
- **macOS:** Use Homebrew: `brew install git`.
- **Linux:** Use your distribution's package manager, e.g., `sudo apt-get install git`.

## Project Configuration

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and execute:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/esp32-s3-hello-world.git
cd esp32-s3-hello-world
